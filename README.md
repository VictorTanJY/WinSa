**About The Project**


Covid-19 has resulted employees to work from home, leaving non-tech savvy employees in-charge of the overall security of the remote working laptop. To assist remote working employees, this program was created to benchmark the security portion of the computer and remediate all failed tests. Thus, employees who are not tech savvy can improve and rectify security vulnerabilities found on their computer easily.
